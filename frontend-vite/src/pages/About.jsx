        <p className="base-text">
          I studied at Cal Poly SLO, completing my undergrad in 2024. At my time there, I worked as a research assistant 
          for the CSSE department, where we discovered the difficulties underrepresented groups face when obtaining opportunities 
          and collaborations due to demographic characteristics such as ethnicity. 

          I also interned at a local startup called JackRabbit, where we created a marketplace to foster a community that 
          trades used/new construction materials.
